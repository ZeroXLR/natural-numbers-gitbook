## Introduction

In this GitBook I rigorously prove properties about the natural numbers from first principles. By _first principles_, I refer to [_**informal set theory**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_set_theory) and the [_**Peano axioms**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms). I assume the former to be self-explanatory; in other words, the reader should have basic working knowledge of set theory (e.g. proving set equality, understanding unions, intersections and power sets, knowing various proof methods, etc). Instead, I begin directly by listing the latter (the Peano axioms) in the next chapter.
